****Project Summary*****
************************

This project predicts the most readable background color between white or black
given a matrix of rgb values. A neural network was developed from scratch that uses
backpropagation and gradient descent to accurately predict the background color using
a set of data created from a preset color contrast function. Essentially, this neural
network is used to emulate that color contrast function.

From this project I learned: how to properly document my work using Rmarkdown, neural 
network concepts and how to interpret the results using a ROC curve.
